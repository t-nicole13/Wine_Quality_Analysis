# Wine_Quality_Analysis

## Objective

This project uses supervised machine learning models to predict the quality of red and white wines.  I used the following models: Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  My goal is to assess which model is best used to predict wine quality.

- Multiple Linear Regression: Tries to predict a dependent variable based on multiple independent variables.

- Decision Tree: Encodes a series of true-or-false questions that we can interpret as if-else statements.  

- Random Forest: Will sample the data and build several smaller, simpler decision trees.  Each tree is considered a “weak classifier,” but when you combine them, they form a “strong classifier".


### Tasks
1. Clean and process the data.
2. Choose target and feature variables.
3. Standardize the features.
4. Split training and testing data.
5. Instantiate the machine learning model.
6. Evaluate the model performance based on classification scores.
7. Calculate the classification accuracy score or R2 Score.
